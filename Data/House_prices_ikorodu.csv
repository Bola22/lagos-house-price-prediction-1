Securi","When it comes to land investment and development, it goes without saying that Lagos is one of the most appreciable places to buy, invest and make huge returns on your investment. A market trend on the popular real estate site, Nigria Property Centre, bears out this fact.

It is also evident that for the discerning investor, what is paramount is massive and optimal returns on any land investment made and when you come to Lagos, the best place to achieve massive growth in your land portfolio is Ibeju Lekki. Presently called the New Lagos, Ibeju Lekki is poised to become the most developed area in West Africa with the huge potential to be one of the best real estate decision you will ever make as countless developments are presently coming up within the axis.

King’s Gate 2 thus offers you the opportunity to key into the massive potentials in the Ibeju Lekki sector as it is a developed estate located at Imosan off Igbogun, via La Campaign Tropicana Resort, Free Trade Zone, Ibeju Lekki, Lagos with close proximity to The Dangote Refinery, Lekki Deep Seaport, La Campaign Tropicana, Lekki Golf Course, Alaro City, Eleganza Industries, Pan Atlantic University, Markets, Filling Stations and various other developments.

The Estate neighbourhood is presently populated with pockets of dwellers and investors readily building their properties. The estate is a prime land that will position your land portfolio for the next wave of dwellers and homeowners that are coming down to the area considering the economic catalysts within the Free Trade Zone axis such as the Dangote Refinery, Lekki Deep Sea Port, The Eleganza Industries, Alaro City and The New International Airport."
