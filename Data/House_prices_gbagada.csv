It is also evident that for the discerning investor, what is paramount is massive and optimal returns on any land investment made and when you come to Lagos, the best place to achieve massive growth in your land portfolio is Ibeju Lekki. Presently called the New Lagos, Ibeju Lekki is poised to become the most developed area in West Africa with the huge potential to be one of the best real estate decision you will ever make as countless developments are presently coming up within the axis.

King’s Gate 2 thus offers you the opportunity to key into the massive potentials in the Ibeju Lekki sector as it is a developed estate located at Imosan off Igbogun, via La Campaign Tropicana Resort, Free Trade Zone, Ibeju Lekki, Lagos with close proximity to The Dangote Refinery, Lekki Deep Seaport, La Campaign Tropicana, Lekki Golf Course, Alaro City, Eleganza Industries, Pan Atlantic University, Markets, Filling Stations and various other developments.

The Estate neighbourhood is presently populated with pockets of dwellers and investors readily building their properties. The estate is a prime land that will position your land portfolio for the next wave of dwellers and homeowners that are coming down to the area considering the economic catalysts within the Free Trade Zone axis such as the Dangote Refinery, Lekki Deep Sea Port, The Eleganza Industries, Alaro City and The New International Airport."

This would be best suited for a single employed female and you can contact me if you meet this criterion. As this is a shared apartment and due to my preference, I would not be in a position to accommodate students, business owners, unemployed property seekers or remote workers. The expectation is that the person to contact me is a responsible adult. Privacy and calm in a home are important to me and I would appreciate a person who shares my views on the matter. Due to the nature of the accommodation mutual respect is important and I prefer a person who is not noisy and would not expect constant visitors. The monthly rent is N50, 000 and there will be a N5, 000 charge for power monthly (prepaid meter). There will also be a one-time payment of N20, 000 and a commitment of three months stay minimum. So if you don't have to commit to 1 year payment. Excitingly, there will be power/electricity for 24hours daily which makes the power charge worth it.
